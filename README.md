## Introduction

Developed for the Avalanche blockchain, New Wave is a decentralized application (dApp) that aims to provide a seamless and secure experience for users interacting with blockchain technology. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the EVM, ensuring transparency and immutability.

## Features

- **Token Management**: Create, deploy, and manage ERC-20 tokens.
- **React Frontend**: A responsive and intuitive user interface built with React.
- **Hardhat Integration**: Robust development environment with Hardhat for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Designed with security best practices and scalability in mind.

## Installation

To get started with New Wave, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/new-wave.git
    cd new-wave
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
    ```sh
    INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
    PRIVATE_KEYS=your_private_keys
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm start
```
This will launch the React application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts to a network, use the Hardhat scripts:

1. Compile the contracts:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

2. Deploy the contracts:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network your_network
    ```

## Testing

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
```sh
npm test
```

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **Ethers.js**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Chai**: Assertion library for testing.
